ExperimentName: Example

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Drilling
# --------

# Simulated data for calibration. One halo catalog per kappa map,
# environment variables and wildcards will be expanded:
CalibrationCatalogs: $PANGLOSS_DIR/calib/Millennium/catalog_example.*
CalibrationKappamaps: $PANGLOSS_DIR/calib/Millennium/kappa*.fits 

# Observed data:
ObservedCatalog: $PANGLOSS_DIR/example/example_catalog.txt

# Position of desired lightcone centre (in J2000 *radians*, 
# with nRA = -Right Ascension):
nRA: -0.033
Dec: -0.020
# BUG: this is a non-standard coordinate system...

# If the lightcone has a strong lens in it, set the following to > 0.0:
StrongLensRedshift: 0.6
# Both observations and calibrations must correspond to the same zs:
SourceRedshift: 1.4

# How big do you want your lightcones?
LightconeRadius: 2.0  # in arcminutes
LightconeDepth: 26.0  # AB magnitude limit
LightconeDepthBand: i

# How many calibration lightcones do you want?
NCalibrationLightcones: 10#00

# Destination directory for the calibration lightcones:
CalibrationFolder: $PANGLOSS_DIR/calib

# The observed lightcone catalog is kept in the current directory.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reconstruction
# --------------

# We want the PDF Pr(kappah|D), in the form of a list of samples - or
# equivalently, realisations of the lightcone mass distribution:
NRealisations: 10#0

StellarMass2HaloMassRelation: Behroozi 
# No other options encoded so far...

# Halo mass function catalog for empirical Pr(Mh):
HMFfile: $PANGLOSS_DIR/calib/SHMR/HaloMassRedshiftCatalog.pickle

# Assumed photo z uncertainty:
PhotozError: 0.1

# Assumed Mstar uncertainty:
PhotometricMstarError: 0.45 # dex
SpectroscopicMstarError: 0.15 # dex

RayTracingScheme: sum
# The default ray-traced kappamap from Hilbert et al 2008 was made by 
# simply summing the convergences on each lens plane. If you want a more
# complicated scheme for kappa_ext or mu_ext, you will need to change
# this. This is the correct scheme for weak lensing, but may need some
# modification if the system contains a strong lens

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Calibrating
# --------------

# For a robust transformation between Pr(kappah|D) and Pr(kappa|D), we 
# found we needed to go through a compression step, to reduce the
# influence of the poorly estimated high kappa halos. Pr(kappa|<kappah>)
# (where <> denotes the median) seems to work well.
Comparator: kappa_h
ComparatorType: median

<<<<<<< HEAD
ComparatorWidth: 0.01 # we want to compare calibration lines of sight with exactly the same calibrator as the real line of sight, but that's unrealistic; we weight each line of sight by its similarity to our calibrator, using a gaussian of the width specified above. This is sadly done by fiat.
=======
# Do we want to make the joint distribution only, or do we want to slice
# that joint distribution to make the final Pr(kappa) distribution?
CalibrateMode: Joint
# CalibrateMode: JointAndSlice
# CalibrateMode: Slice
