\begin{abstract} 

Strong gravitational lenses can provide high precision cosmological distance
measurements; one of the most important sources of systematic error in these
estimates is the additional mass along the line of sight to the source. Weak
lensing by galaxies and groups in this beam can contribute an ``external
convergence'' $\xkappa$ that dominates the  uncertainty in the inferred
distances; likewise, it may also contaminate estimates of the luminosity of
objects at high redshift (such as reionisation-era proto-galaxies, and type Ia
supernovae standard candles).  We characterise this uncertainty by marginalising
over a probability density function for $\xkappa$: here, we investigate the use
of a simple halo model to estimate $\Pr(\xkappa)$ given noisy estimates of the
photometric redshift and stellar mass of galaxies observed in optical imaging
surveys of the field in question. Tests using mock catalogs from the Millenium
Simulation and comparing to ray-traced $kappa$ values, we find that \ldots 
The $\Pr(\xkappa)$ from this reconstruction process are narrower than the
expected distribution of $\xkappa$ values over an ensemble of time delay lenses:
incorporating the photometric catalogs in a joint analysis of 100 lenses 
leads to an increase in precision of factor of 1.X over simple averaging. We
investigate several sources of bias and determine \ldots

\section{Introduction}

What is the problem - reconstructing kappa. Why is this problem relevant? Time
delay distances. Magnification. 

Previous work on environments: Auger, Momcheva,
others. Hilbert et al.'s raytracing plus Fassnacht \& Koopmans density, Suyu et
al's kappa pdf. 

Why these approaches may be insufficient - information provided in
future surveys. 

Questions asked in this paper:
How much of the total external convergence in a time delay lens system comes from visible galaxies? How does this change as a function of magnitude cut?
Where are the most important galaxies? Do the massive galaxies dominate, or is it the the galaxies nearest the optical axis, or some combination of these? How many galaxies account for 50%, and 95% of the convergence on a typical line of sight?
Can the Hilbert (ray-traced) convergence be recovered by halo model lightcone reconstruction? With what scatter and bias? Which recipes are the dominant sources of these uncertainties?

This paper is organized as follows. \Sref{sec:}.   

Throughout this paper magnitudes are given in the AB system \citep{Oke74} and
we adopt standard ``concordance'' parameters for our reference cosmology, \ie
$h=0.7$, $\Omega_m=0.3$ and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.7$, where the symbols indicate
the Hubble Constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and the matter and
dark energy density of the Universe in units of the critical density
\citep[e.g.\ ][]{Kom++09}.

\section{Theoretical Background}
\label{sec:theory}

Time delay distances, and the mass sheet degeneracy - how kappa is degenerate in
strong lens models (and magnifications). Weak lensing by NFW halos. Accounting
for mass along the line of sight.  Approximations to full ray tracing: combining
kappas: simple sum, Keeton scaling, comments. Example ray traced kappa map from Stefan. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Halo Model}
\label{sec:model}

Halos. N-body sims provide mass framework. MS halo catalog. Truncated spherical
NFW approx based on virial masses. Stellar mass. Halo map corresponding to
ray-traced kappa map, for illustration. Small-scale structure 

Not all DM is in halo catalog. Smooth component approximation.  How voids
produce a negative kappa - filled beam distances require halos and voids to
provide density contrast relative to mean. How we correct for voids. Comments on
reasonable, but unphysical nature of this approach, tests to follow. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tests with known halo mass and redshift}
\label{sec:} 

Raytracing through n-body particles as 'truth'. Motivation for assuming perfect
knowledge of halo mass and z = testing model of previous section. Deterministic
prediction of kappa.

Is truncation choice important? How deep and wide does a reconstruction need to
go? What is the irreducible uncertainty on kappa from this halo model? (Bias and
scatter) Can use the ideal reconstruction to ask: Where does the kappa come
from? Close to the LoS? Bright objects? How many objects are important? What
error is made by considering subsets of available objects? 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Tests on mock catalogs}
\label{sec:}

Consider three sources of scatter in the halo model: zphot, Mstar|zphot, and
Mhalo|Mstar,zphot. Mechanism for including scatter in model: draw samples from
PDFs. Result is not one predicted kappa, but one P(kappa) for each lightcone.
This is what is required by single-lens analyses. 

We can draw samples from this PDF and ask:

How is the kappa inference offset and blurred by uncertainty on redshift, Mstar
and Mhalo? 

What is the effect of using the wrong Mstar-Mhalo relation? 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Time Delay Distances}
\label{sec:} 

Folding the kappa uncertainties into time delay distance uncertainties. Toy
model: same zl and zs, allows simple product of pdfs to obtain estimate of P(D).

What is the expected bias and scatter (centroid position and width) of P(D) as a
function of N lenses? How does reconstruction compare with P(D) derived using
P(kappa|N45) for each lightcone? How does reconstruction compare with P(D)
derived assuming kappa=0 for each lightcone?
