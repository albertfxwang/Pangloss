\section{Introduction}
\todo{Phil,(+ Tom)}{Update introduction to reflect the scope of this paper}

Every distant object we observe has had its shape distorted, and size
and total brightness magnified (or demagnified) by a compound lens constructed
from all the mass distributed between us and it. As \citet{valewhite2003} and \citet{hilbert}
showed, there are no empty lightcones in our universe. This fact makes gravitational lensing a potentially important source of systematic error for any estimate of luminosity or distance.

\citet{suyu} found that in time delay lens cosmography the
lensing effect of mass structures along the (unusually over-dense) line of
sight to the quadruply-imaged radio source B1608$+$656, the so-called ``external
convergence'' $\kappax$, was the dominant source of uncertainty in the inferred
cosmological parameters. The problem is that one simply doesn't know
how magnified and distorted the source has been because the unlensed source is unobservable. The external shear can potentially be recovered in the mass-modelling of the lens, but the convergence is undetectable from the image positions, shapes and relative fluxes; this is the famous {\emph{  mass sheet-degeneracy}} \citep[see e.g.][for details]{falco}.

In order to justify the reconstruction proceedure outlined in Section \ref{sec:model}, we would like to apply it to lines of sight with known $\kappa$.\notes{can't use real los, have to use \MS}

\subsection{How does $\kappah$ relate to $\kappa$?}
Given the halo mass catalogue from the Millenium Simulation, 
and convergence maps produced by ray-tracing through the MS's n-body particles, 
it is possible to test the validity of the prescription outlined
 in Section \ref{sec:model}. We test the model by comparing $\kappah$ against
 the ray-traced $\kappa$. If the reconstruction process is to be
 succesfull the two quantities should be closely related, although we expect $\kappah$ to be offset from $\kappa$ since the former does not include the divergence due to voids.
